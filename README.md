# MFA-RO-Website-Project README

## Overview

Welcome to the MFA-RO-Website-Project! This project has been a remarkable journey for me, as it marks my initiation into the world of freelance web development. Over the course of the past 10 days, I've embarked on this exciting adventure, learning a plethora of new skills and gaining valuable experience.

I owe this opportunity to my friend Suraj Kumar from Ullas Trust, who entrusted me with this substantial project.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to create a website for Modi Water Purifier, a prominent RO water purifier company. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ashok Gupta, the Business Head, and Pankaj Gupta, the Admin, for providing me with this fantastic opportunity to contribute to their digital presence.
